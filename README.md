# Happy Thoughts

In this week's project, you'll be able to practice your React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

At first, I broke down the tasks into several different parts to get a clear overview of what I needed to do. Along the way, I encountered minor obstacles where I console logged a lot to identify the problems, and then fixed them.
